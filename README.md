Hi there 👋

I’m Yasin, a Computer Engineering student with a strong curiosity for how software and hardware actually work under the hood 🧠⚙️

I enjoy building things that make sense — especially on the **backend** 🛠️
During my internships, I worked with **.NET**, **Web API**, and **SQL**, where I learned how real-world systems are designed, broken, and fixed again 🔁
Clean architecture, readable code, and solving problems step by step matter to me more than flashy shortcuts ✨

At university, I’ve worked on web-based projects using **PHP**, including a website developed with a **vibe coding approach** — focusing on rapid iteration, experimentation, and learning by building 🌐⚡

I also have a growing interest in **cybersecurity** 🔐
I’m familiar with basic networking concepts, including **networks**, **protocols**, and **connections**, and I enjoy understanding how systems communicate — and where they can fail 🌍📡

I’m a team-oriented, open-minded, and problem-solving–focused engineering student 🤝
I actively use AI tools as thinking partners, not shortcuts 🤖
I’m continuously pushing myself to improve — technically and mentally 📈

Right now, I’m exploring software engineering more deeply while keeping a close eye on hardware architecture, because the best software respects the machine it runs on 💻🔍
I aim to contribute to technology in ways that are practical, thoughtful, and actually useful 🚀
